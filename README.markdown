# Ruby Documentation Translation Project #

This project is meant to provide translations of the core Ruby and standard library documentation. The current process is a follows:

 * A custom tool interfaces with the RDoc parser to extract basic translatable content from C and Ruby source files
 * The translateable content is output to a YAML file
 * Translators translate the YAML content into their language
 * (In Progress) RDoc integrates these translations into the output generation process to provide translated output

The rules for translation can be found at the project's GitHub wiki page:
